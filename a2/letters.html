                <p class='cardnote'>(Letter to Dad)</p>
                <p class='cardcontent'> Today I received a long-delayed letter from you dated Oct. 4th and containing twelve stamps. They would have been very welcome if I had got them at the right time, but by the look of the envelope the letter has been travelling about a
                    bit â€“ I will enclose it just for fun. Anyway, I was jolly glad to get it and hope you will find time to write to me again. I also got a very welcome letter from Dot today, dated Dec. 7th and it was very interesting to hear news of
                    things in Gympie and especially news of the family affairs. Having already written a long letter to Mag and P.Cds to Ivy which will be going by the same mail as this, I have very little news to tell you so this letter will be short.
                    We are getting plenty of hard training and will be fit to go to the front at anytime now and according to what we hear it may not be long. The Turks are beginning to move and we might meet them, anyway, we are always kept ready to
                    move at 24 </p>
