                <p>Dear Mother, </p>
                <p>We are now miles from any sign of civilization with the dreary monotonous sand stretching in all directions. Two days before leaving Tel-el-Kebir Camp I received your most bonsorful parcel containing so many good things and just those
                    I most needed. What a pleasure it was when I opened it and realized how much the dear ones at home were thinking of me, although I knew all the time that I am constantly in your thoughts as you all are in mine. Yet how much nearer
                    it seemed to bring us for was I not handling all those articles and reading such loving messages which had so recently been sent on their long journey by those I love best. How pleased I was to have that Photo of the dear Dad which
                    Mag sent, I know how much she must have prized it and it needs no assurance of mine for her to know that it will be well cared for and treasured. </p>
                <p>The parcel arrived in good condition, nothing on the list being missing. The only thing I did not need was, I am glad to say, the insectibane but I am hanging on to it.</p>
                <p>Feb 3rd. Yesterday, dear Mother, I had only written one page when I had to leave off and now I will try and get on a little further. It will be better, I think, if I go back a little and tell you our movements since striking camp at Tel-el-Kebir.
                    On the morning of the 25th Jan. we received orders to pack up, strike tents and be ready to move. At 4.30 p.m. we entrained in open trucks which were much more comfortable than the 3rd class carriages in which we are generally placed.
                    The country in all directions as far as the eye could see was as flat as a billiard table and mostly bare sand, although at places there were cultivations that relieved the monotony of things. We travelled fairly fast but had many
                    stoppages, so that when night fell we were still going and no one had any idea where we were bound for. Our movements are never disclosed – it is such a glorious uncertainty. About 8.30 p.m. our train reached its destination, by then
                    it was getting rather cold so we were glad to get out and move about a little. But we soon got warm for our Section was told off to unload the train, which we did in record time after piling our arms. We still had a very hazy idea
                    of our position but thought it would be somewhere near the Suez Canal. The name of the station was “Serapeum” but this you may be sure conveyed no meaning to us whatever. The order to make ourselves comfortable for the night was passed
                    along, so we immediately set to, to carry it out. Tom Johnstone and I were together so we dug a hole in the sand about 7 feet long, 31/2 feet wide and 18 inches deep, spread our blankets, took off our boots and turned in, but before
                    doing so we had supper on sardines, bread and butter and water. In front of us was a narrow fringe of trees and in the morning we discovered that the Suez Canal was only about 10 yards distant on the other side. We could not cross
                    the Canal where we were but had to march a mile along the bank to the crossing place. All the battalion stores were placed on camels and we had the job of unloading them. It was funny indeed to watch the chaps trying to get the camels
                    to lie down. You have to make a peculiar noise in the throat to get them down – I will not attempt to spell it – it is a noise similar to what you would make when trying to make a child drop something dirty that she had picked up.
                    One beast of a camel that I was unloading got up when I was untying the ropes and sent me flying almost into the Canal. Eventually we got everything into a lighter and were towed across to the other side.</p>
                <p>The Engineers were busy making a pontoon bridge across the Canal and in the meantime everything had to be taken across in lighters and tugs. On landing on the eastern side we proceeded to a camp about a mile inland – pitched our tents
                    and did other necessary fatigue work. In this camp we did not do much work, only going out once on parade with the guns to practice “signalling”, “gun mounting”, and getting into action. We had only got nicely settled down when orders
                    again came to move so on the morning of Friday, Jan 28th 1916 we packed up, struck tents and once more loaded all our goods on camels. About 50 camels were brought along for us and each one is supposed to be able to carry from 6 to
                    10 cwt. (1830 to 3050kg) (cwt. = hundredweight = 112 pounds weight = 305 kg.). They are freaks of animals in many ways but are great for travelling across the desert. As you know, they are able to go without water for 7 days – I think
                    it is stowed away in their humps and when they want water you will hear a gurgling noise and about a foot (30 cm.) of their tongue will come out all sloppy and swelled with water. Our section was told off as camel guard and walked
                    along with them – first stowing our equipment on their backs. The camels had niggers as drivers – one driver to every two camels and we moved at a fair pace across the desert when once we got started. There were many delays and the
                    loading of the camels took some time so that it was nearly one o’clock in the afternoon when we got started. It was a weary march across the desert and we were glad when we reached our present camp which is, I believe, about nine miles
                    from the Canal. </p>
                <p>One of our fellows mounted a camel when it was down but as soon as it started to get up he went flying over its head into the sand – he did not try again. Directly we got here we had to set to, unload the camels and pitch our tents. This
                    place is to be the first line of defence and the companies are busy making trenches. We of the M.G. Section have very little to do, but tomorrow I believe we start building positions for our guns. The food we get here is not quite
                    up to the mark but very likely will improve when things get settled. So far we only get hard biscuits and bully-beef and a little tea. Water is very scarce, we only get a bottle full a day, at first we did not get that much and have
                    been that thirsty that we were glad to buy it from the camel drivers at 1 piastre [two and a half pence] (about 2 cents) a bottle.</p>
                <p> All around us there is nothing but a dreary expanse of sand – the nights are fairly cold but the sun is hot in the day time. Behind us we can just see the fringe of trees that line the other side of the Suez Canal. This place, we have
                    been told, is where the Turks made their attack last February. Will they come here again? Nearly every afternoon we play football and there are great games between No. 1 tent and No. 2 tent of our Section. I am feeling well and getting
                    in great nick. </p>
                <p>And now, dear Mother, you have all the news up to date. It is now almost 8 p.m. and lights will soon be out so I must close. Some chaps are going from this camp to Cairo in the morning so I will get them to post this letter for me. I do
                    hope you are all in good health and getting along alright. On account of our moving from Tel-el-Kebir I was unable to get any money although I had sent for it. Will write again soon. Good-bye and good luck, Your loving son.</p>
