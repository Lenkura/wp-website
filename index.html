        <h3>Who is your tutor / instructor</h3>
        <div>Trevor Reynolds</div>

        <h3>Who is your labber / workshopper</h3>
        <div>Srikanth Thudumu</div>

        <h3>Have you any programming or web design experience?</h3>
        <div>I have taken other courses at RMIT related to IT, such as Programming 1. Otherwise it's mostly self experimentation and tinkering in my spare time.</div>

        <h3>Do you see yourself as a programmer, designer, or both?</h3>
        <div>My personal projects see myself act in both of these results and I've enjoyed both of them. If I had to pick one, I would say I enjoy programming more and would be more keen to pursue a career in this area</div>

        <h3>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</h3>
        <div>I was looking for a career change, particulary in the IT field. RMIT offered online courses which worked best with my schedule. Coupled with a few personal recommendations, I decided to undertake this course at RMIT.</div>

        <h3>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</h3>
        <div>I'd hope I could design and create a functional website by the end of this course.</div>

        <h3>What websites do you use the most?</h3>
        <div>When I find myself procrastinating, which is often, I generally wonder over to reddit or youtube. Otherwise I frequently pop over to Ozbargain to see if I can pick up something for cheap</div>

        <h3>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</h3>
        <div>In my spare time, you can find me either playing video games or taking care of my garden. Recently with being stuck at home, I acquired a Raspberry Pi and have been tinkering with that. Currently I'm trying to set it up as a media centre</div>
