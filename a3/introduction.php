            <h2>Introduction & How to Read</h2>
            <h3>By Douglas Richard Baker (Son of Douglas Raymond Baker)</h3>
            <p>These are copies of letters written by my father Douglas Raymond Baker during the First World War (1914-1918) to his family in Gympie. I have three thick exercise books in which the letters were copied in hand writing by my Aunt Alice, his
                sister. I understand that this was done so his letters could be sent on to other members of the family. I don’t know if the originals are still in existence, probably not.</p>
            <p>In the early letters Alice has not included the name of the person they were written to but later she writes at the beginning, “Letter to Dot”, “Letter to Mother”, etc. and later still copies the original, “Dear Al”, “Dear Mag”, etc.. Likewise
                the endings are often not laid out fully as we would do but Al may have done this or Dad may have been saving space on the page.</p>
            <p>Some letters are slightly out of date order in the books but as most of these are around the time his father died I have put them in the correct order as this is crucial to understanding the sense of the contents. A lot will be missing – many,
                many ships were sunk but thanks to Aunt Alice we have these copies of the ones that did get through. </p>
            <p>Where Dad used brackets in a letter I have used [ ] style and where I have made any comment or explanation I have used ( ) and Italics.</p>
            <p>Where he uses the word “gay” it is used in the true sense, bright, happy, carefree, etc., This is the original meaning of the word before it became associated with the homosexual community.</p>
            <p>The amounts of money are, of course, in Pounds, shillings and pence but as these are out of date and we have no pounds sign in the computer I have written them in, sometimes showing the decimal equivalents. One Pound equalled $2, one shilling
                equalled 10 cents and one penny equalled a little under one cent. After a while I stopped putting the equivalents in as they had cno significance unless you knew the relative cost of things then and now. A shilling – equivalent to ten
                cents might actually alent to ten cents might actually buy buy ten or twenty dollars worth of goods now.</p>
